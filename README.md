# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a Tic Tac Toe game project created using the REPL.it platform within the Python language. The board is set up as an empty string list and calls upon the respective functions (shown in the code) to start the game.

## Game Logic

The game logic is as follows:

1. After the program has decided which player goes first, show the board and then a player chooses their position.
2. Place the marker on the position based on user input.

## How to Play

1. Open the TicTacToe.py file in a Python IDE.
2. Run the file.
3. When prompted, enter your name and choose your marker (X or O).
4. The game will randomly decide which player goes first.
5. Choose a position on the board by entering a number from 1 to 9.
6. The game will continue until a player wins or the board is full.

## Requirements

This game requires Python 3 to be installed on your machine.
